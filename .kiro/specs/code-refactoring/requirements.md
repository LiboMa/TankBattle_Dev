# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This project aims to refactor the existing tank game codebase into a modular structure without changing the framework or implementation details. The refactoring will organize the code into logical modules based on functionality, making it more maintainable, easier to understand, and better structured for future development. The refactored code will maintain all existing features and behaviors while improving code organization.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the code to be organized into logical modules, so that it's easier to maintain and extend.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the refactoring is complete THEN all code should be organized into appropriate directories based on functionality
2. WHEN examining the code structure THEN it should follow the specified directory structure:
   - src/
     - config/
     - scenes/
     - entities/
     - utils/
     - index.html
     - index.js
3. WHEN the refactoring is complete THEN all existing functionality should remain intact
4. WHEN the refactoring is complete THEN no implementation details or algorithms should be changed

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the game configuration to be centralized, so that it's easier to modify game parameters.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN examining the refactored code THEN all game configuration should be in the src/config/ directory
2. WHEN modifying game parameters THEN changes should only need to be made in the configuration files
3. WHEN the game loads THEN it should properly use the configuration from the config files

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the game scenes to be separated into individual files, so that each scene's logic is isolated and easier to understand.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN examining the refactored code THEN each game scene should be in its own file in the src/scenes/ directory
2. WHEN a scene needs to be modified THEN only the relevant scene file should need to be changed
3. WHEN the game transitions between scenes THEN it should properly load and unload the appropriate scene files

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want game entities to be defined in separate files, so that entity logic is encapsulated and reusable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN examining the refactored code THEN each entity type should be defined in its own file in the src/entities/ directory
2. WHEN an entity's behavior needs to be modified THEN only the relevant entity file should need to be changed
3. WHEN entities interact with each other THEN they should maintain all existing behaviors

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want utility functions to be organized in a dedicated directory, so that common functionality is easy to find and reuse.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN examining the refactored code THEN utility functions should be organized in the src/utils/ directory
2. WHEN the game needs audio management THEN it should use the AudioManager from utils/AudioManager.js
3. WHEN the game needs gamepad support THEN it should use the GamepadManager from utils/GamepadManager.js
4. WHEN the game needs debug functionality THEN it should use the DebugManager from utils/DebugManager.js
5. WHEN the game needs settings management THEN it should use the GameSettingsManager from utils/GameSettingsManager.js
6. WHEN the game needs latency optimization THEN it should use the GamepadLatencyOptimizer from utils/GamepadLatencyOptimizer.js

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the entry point of the application to be clear and minimal, so that the initialization flow is easy to understand.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN examining the refactored code THEN index.html should be the main HTML entry point
2. WHEN examining the refactored code THEN index.js should be the main JavaScript entry point
3. WHEN the game starts THEN it should properly initialize all required modules and start the game

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the refactored code to maintain all existing functionality, so that the game works exactly as before.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the refactored game runs THEN all existing features should work as they did before
2. WHEN playing the refactored game THEN there should be no regressions in gameplay
3. WHEN using game controllers THEN all controller functionality should work as before
4. WHEN using game settings THEN all settings should work as before
5. WHEN the game audio plays THEN it should work as it did before
